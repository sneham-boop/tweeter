3. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in Google Chrome or Safari browsers.
4. Tweet form slides down by clicking on the bouncy white arrows and user can directly start typing their tweet.
5. Tweets cannot exceed **140** characters and cannot be **empty** or **all spaces**. User will be alerted if these conditions are not met.
6. Scroll down to see existing tweets in the database. 
7. Scroll all the way up by clicking the up button on the bottom of the screen.

## Known issues
